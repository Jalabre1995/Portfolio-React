# Portfolio-React

# Purpose
The purpose of thsi assignment was to work on our porfolio. But instead of using regular index HTML, we had to create an React Application and deploy it on Heroku. This assignmet is very important to let employers know what you have been working on. 

# New Frameworks

The two frameworks that I used for my portfolio is reactstrap(https://reactstrap.github.io/) And react-MLD(https://tleunen.github.io/react-mdl/). It made starting a react application from scratch much easier to build. 

# Challenges
The Challenges that I came across react is the getting the pathways to connect. I was having a hard time connecting the paths together until my professor helped me. All I was missing was a dash and everything connected.
